            "bio": "I started knitting at age seven because it was safer than embroidery, and landed my first professional gig in 1962, at age 14, when I was commissioned  to knit three angora sweaters for a girl at my school.<br /><br />Thus I grew up with knitting as much a part of my world as eating. It’s what we did. And although my primary profession was teaching high school English, when my son was little and I wanted to work from home it made sense to open a knitting school next door. ",

              "bio": "It’s not your grandmother’s craft anymore. A recent viral crafts meme: arm knitting, in which stitches are formed using not needles but the knitter’s arms and hands. I don’t arm knit. My approach is rigorously professional. I will not knit in public. He won’t make socks or hats. I avoid synthetic yarn. He won't knit a sweater for my partner of eight years, a corporate lawyer who works in Washington, although that’s just common sense. Everybody knows about the boyfriend sweater curse.",
